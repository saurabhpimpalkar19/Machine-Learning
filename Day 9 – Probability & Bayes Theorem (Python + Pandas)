📌 Objective

To understand Probability concepts using Python and Pandas, including:

Classical Probability

Conditional Probability

Bayes Theorem

Dice & Cards probability

Real-world data interpretation

This day focuses on thinking like a Data Analyst / ML Engineer.

🧠 Topics Covered
1️⃣ Classical Probability

Sample space

Favorable outcomes

Probability formula

𝑃
(
𝐴
)
=
Favorable outcomes
Total outcomes
P(A)=
Total outcomes
Favorable outcomes
	​

2️⃣ Conditional Probability

Understanding probability given a condition:

𝑃
(
𝐴
∣
𝐵
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
𝑃
(
𝐵
)
P(A∣B)=
P(B)
P(A∩B)
	​

3️⃣ Bayes Theorem

Used to reverse conditional probability:

𝑃
(
𝐴
∣
𝐵
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐵
∣
𝐴
)
×
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
𝑃
(
𝐵
)
P(A∣B)=
P(B)
P(B∣A)×P(A)
