# Day 4 – Pandas for Machine Learning

## Objective
To learn Pandas fundamentals and advanced data manipulation techniques required for real-world machine learning and data analysis tasks.

## Topics Covered

### Pandas Basics
- Introduction to Pandas
- Creating DataFrames
- Understanding rows and columns
- Data inspection (`head`, `tail`, `info`, `describe`)
- Column and row selection

### Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values (`isnull`, `fillna`)
- Mean, median, and mode imputation
- Removing duplicate records
- Sorting data

### Feature Engineering
- Creating new columns using `apply` and `lambda`
- Salary categorization (High / Low)
- Data transformation techniques

### Data Analysis
- `value_counts()` for category distribution
- `groupby()` for aggregated analysis
- Department-wise salary analysis

## Practice Tasks
- Student marks classification (Pass / Fail)
- Salary-based categorization
- Cleaning real-world style datasets
- Debugging Pandas `KeyError`

## ML Connection
Pandas is used for:
- Data cleaning before model training
- Feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Preparing datasets for NumPy & ML models

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- VS Code
